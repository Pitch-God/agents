The way it works is I identify the businesses that are in similar niches as the ones you got results in.

And then we book calls directly in your calendar with the ideal clients who are interested. We use a lot of tools, automations and processes for it and target high volume. (depends on how much you want to scale) I am attaching an AI email campaign for another client that booked us 16 calls last month. This was for a Google ads agency targeting medical spas in the US. I'd love to chat with you on how we can help you book more qualified meetings into your calendar. What time works?"

They scaled their top promotions to over $500,000 in monthly spend while maintaining KPI targets. Worth a quick chat next week? Got some ideas for Runway Influence, but want to hear what you already have cooking. Peter"

Daily monitoring allowed us to refine and adjust these keywords for maximum impact continuously. 2. **Geographic Targeting**: By honing in on specific geographic areas, we ensured that the ads reached the most relevant audience. This not only maximized ad spend efficiency but also drove qualified leads more likely to convert. 3. **Data-Driven Adjustments**: Daily data analysis was crucial. It enabled us to pivot quickly and make precise adjustments to the campaigns based on real-time performance metrics, ensuring we stayed on track to meet and exceed ROI goals. If you're open to discussing this further, I'd be happy to dive deeper into the specifics on a quick call. We can walk through some ideas and see how we can tailor a similar strategy for Signal Signs and Graphics. Let me know if there's a convenient time for you! Lexi"
