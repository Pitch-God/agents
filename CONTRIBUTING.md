# Contributing to Pitchgod Email Agent Project

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Ensure your code follows the project's style guidelines
4. Make sure your code lints
5. Issue that pull request!

## Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file from `.env.example`
3. Install dependencies
4. Open the project in LangGraph Studio

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code formatting patterns
- Document new functions and significant code blocks
- Keep functions focused and modular

## Project Structure

- `src/prompts/` - Agent prompt definitions
- `src/templates/` - Email response templates
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions
- `src/` - Core application code

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. Update documentation for any modified functionality
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker]

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue]().

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
